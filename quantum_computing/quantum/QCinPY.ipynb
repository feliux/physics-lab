It is, of course, possible to do this without using any of these packages. I think this is much more enlightening. Here, I show how it can be done in a minimalistic, but high-performance way. Though simple, the code below is actually competitive with aforementioned packages in terms of speed. \n",

The following is going to involve a lot of explanation, but in the end only a few lines of code, and overview of which can be found at the end of this page.\n",

    "> Remark 1. Of course, we could also represent states as long, one-dimensional arrays, in the way you were probably thought in your quantum mechanics 101 course. In this case, the operator $X\\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\  |\\psi\\rangle$ would be constructed by taking four Kronecker products. However, this approach is not very efficient, nor very elegant, for systems with $n\\gg4$ qubits. This is because merely constructing the operator $X\\otimes I \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes I$ requires you to create an (albeit sparse) $2^n\\times2^n$ matrix. \n",

Namely, by construction, `np.tensordot(H_matrix,psi,(1,1))`, which contracts the `1`st index of `H_matrix` with the `1`st index of `psi`, produces an array with entries `psi_prime[j,i,k,l]` $=\\sum_{j'}H_{jj'}\\psi_{ij'kl}$. Note the order of the indices: `np.tensordot` contracts indices, but leaves the free indices in the order reading from left to right. This is not what we're used to in quantum mechanics. We don't want an operator to change the order of the qubits. To fix this, we have to move the indices (or axes) back in the right places with [np.moveaxis](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.moveaxis.html?highlight=moveaxis). So, the correct way to construct `psi_prime` is by"

    "In this article, we've seen how to implement basic quantum primitives such as state initialization, the application of small unitary operators such as $H$ and $\\mathrm{CNOT}$, and measurement in the computational basis. Given a good understanding of these primitives, it is easy to define your own primitives, and with a few lines of extra code, you can already implement algorithms such as a variational quantum eigensolver. You could go on and write a proper quantum library that defines gates and circuits as classes, which is outside the scope of the current article. Then you could define a circuit without actually running it, so that you can draw the circuit graphically, or export the gate sequence as OpenQASM. "
